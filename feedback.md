Comments as your fellow:
Great job, Arjan! 5 outta 5! Your models are set up really nicely. I love the gradient background. Your code is clean, simple, and easy to read which I love!

The syntax you used for the SQL query has a security vulnerability which I described in more detail in the `routes/routes.js` file.

This is a more minor comment, instead of using a bunch of `<br>`s, you could add those spaces with CSS. Typically, people use the padding or margin to add extra space between elements. I think `<br>`s are more typically used to add space in a chunk of text that might be within the same element.

For future assignments and projects **please** add a README.md file with instructions on how to use the repo. it should include info such as:

  * instructions/commands to create the database
  * commands or files used to seed the database
  * any npm scripts used to start the server or build the project It's good practice for when you work on larger, public projects. Without these instructions, I also have to go through all your files to understand how to set up, which becomes harder and harder as we start to write more code and use more files.

Comments as a Jamaican: The nostalgia! This made me miss Jamaica so much and I would totally die to see sunsets and be on a beach right now!
